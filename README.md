Cancer, a diagnosis that is so dreaded and scary, that its fear alone can strike even the 
strongest of souls. The disease is often thought of as untreatable and unbearably painful, with
usually, no cure available. Among all the cancers, breast cancer is the second most deadliest ,
especially among women. What decides the patientsâ€™ fate is the early diagnosis of the cancer,
facilitating subsequent clinical management. Mammography plays a vital role in the
screening of breast cancers as it can detect any breast masses or calcifications early. However,
the extremely dense breast tissues pose difficulty in the detection of cancer mass, thus,
encouraging the use of machine learning (ML) techniques and artificial neural networks
(ANN) to assist radiologists in faster cancer diagnosis. This paper explores the MIAS
database, containing 332 digital mammograms from women, which were augmented and
preprocessed, and fed into different convolutional neural network (CNN) models, with the
aim of differentiating healthy tissues from cancerous ones with high accuracy. The paper,
along with a new proposed CNN model for better identification of breast cancer, focuses on
the significance of computer-aided detection (CAD) models overall in the early diagnosis of
breast cancer. While a diagnosis of breast cancer may still leave patients dreaded, we believe
our research can be a symbol of hope for all.
